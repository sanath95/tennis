Build a classifier to differentiate between forehand and backhand
From Video_RGB in thetis data set, I added all videos under backhand and forehand_flat to create the training data.
Chose around 20 random videos from backhand_slice and forehand_slice to prepare the test set.
Chose a few random snaps from google from real life matches to evaluate how well the model performs.
